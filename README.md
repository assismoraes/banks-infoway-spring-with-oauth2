This project is an API for bank transactions. It is also a challange applied by INFOWAY's development recrute team. Both admins and users have to be registered on database to get this API's access. As default this API already has an admin user whose its username is 'admin' and its password is 'admin'.

To access this API and create banks, branches, accounts, and so on, it is necessary access the following route
``` bash
$ localhost:8080/oauth/token?grant_type=password&username=USERNAME&password={PASS}
```
where USERNAME is 'admin' and PASS is 'admin'.

In this an admin can create a bank, branches and accounts for users(bank's clients).

## CREATING A BANK
	Route: /api/bank
	Verb: POST
	Data: {"name" : NAME_OF_THE_BANK_STRING}
	
## EDITING A BANK
	Route: /api/bank
	Verb: PUT
	Data: {"id": ID_OF_THE_BANK_LONG, "name" : NAME_OF_THE_BRANCH_STRING}

	
## DELETING A BANK
	Route: /api/bank/ID_OF_THE_BANK_LONG
	Verb: DELETE


## CREATING A BRANCH
	Route: /api/bank/ID_OF_THE_BANK_LONG/branches
	Verb: POST
	Data: {"name" : NAME_OF_THE_BRANCH_STRING}


## EDITING A BRANCH:
	Route: /api/branch
	Verb: PUT
	Data: {
		"number" : NUMBER_OF_THE_BRANCH_STRING,
		"name" : NEW_NAME_FOR_THE_BRANCH_STRING
		}


## DELETING A BRANCH
	Route: /api/branch/NUMBER_OF_THE_BRANCH_STRING
	Verb: DELETE

## CREATING AN ACCOUNT
	Route: /api/branch/NUMBER_OF_THE_BRANCH_STRING/accounts
	Verb: POST
	Data: {
		"client" : { "registerNumber" : REGISTER_NUMBER_OF_THE_CLIENT_STRING, "name" : NAME_OF_THE_CLIENT_STRING },
		"usr" : { "password" : PASSWORD_OF_THE_CLIENT_STRING }
		}

The users are created by admins user when they create their accounts and they can do transactions like cashing out, trasferring money, make deposit, change password, get current balance and generate transactions extracts. The routes which users have access are showed below:
###Obs.: All the routes needs to be accessed with a access token generated by an authentication. 

``` bash
Example: {ROUTE}?access_token=a1c4a3c3-aef2-4e66-822b-b0cb3f3ded75
```
where ROUTE is one of below.

## DEPOSITING MONEY
	Route: /api/transaction/deposit
	Verb: POST
	Data: {"value" : DEPOSIT_VALUE_DOUBLE}


## DEPOSITING IN ANY ACCOUNT
	Route: /api/transaction/deposit/DESTINY_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_STRING
	Verb: POST
	Data: {"value" : DEPOSITED_VALUE_DOUBLE}


## CASHING OUT
	Rota: /api/transaction/cashOut
	Verb: POST
	Data: {"value" : CASH_OUT_VALUE_DOUBLE}


## TRANSFERRING
	Rota: /api/transaction/transfer/DESTINY_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_STRING
	Verb: POST
	Data: {"value" : VALUE_TO_BE_TRANSFERRED_DOUBLE}


## GENERATING ACCOUNT EXTRACT
	Rota: /api/transaction/START_DATE_LONG/FINISH_DATE_LONG
	Verb: GET
	Return: {
		"id": TRANSACTION_ID_LONG,
		"createdAt": TRANSACTION_DATE_LONG,
		"otherAccountNumber": OTHER_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_STRING or NULL,
		"value": TRANSACTION_VALUE_DOUBLE
	    }


## OBSERVATIONS ABOUT TRASACTIONS EXTRACTS:

###The object json with the list of transactions obeys the following logic
> 
> 1.	CASH OUT: When the value of the transaction is NEGATIVE and the transaction has not the number of another account (otherAccountNumber = null)
> 2. 	Transfer 1(DEBIT): When the value of the transaction is NEGATIVE and the transaction has the number of another account (otherAccountNumber! = Null)
> 3.	Deposit: When the value of the transaction is POSITIVE and the transaction does not have a the number of another account(otherAccountNumber == null)
> 4.	Transfer 2(CREDIT): When the value of the transaction is positive and the transaction has the number of another account (otherAccountNumber! = Null)


## CHANGING PASSWORD
	Rota: /api/usr/changePassword
	Verb: POST
	Data: {
		"currentPassword" : CURRENT_PASSWORD_STRING
		"newPassword" : NEW_PASSWORD_STRING,
		"newPasswordConfirm" : NEW_PASSWORD_CONFIRM_STRING,
	}

## GETTING CURRENT BALANCE
	Rota: api/usr/getCurrentBalance/
	Verb: GET
